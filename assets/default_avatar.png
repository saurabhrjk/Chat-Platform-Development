# This is a placeholder for a binary file.
# Create a simple, generic avatar image (e.g., a silhouette or initials)
# and save it as 'default_avatar.png' in the 'assets' directory.
# For example, a plain colored circle or a simple outline of a person.
# If you have an actual image file, its content would go here if this were a text representation.
# Since it's binary, just ensure the file exists in your project's assets folder.
